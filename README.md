### ⏱️ Timer
Timer allows you to program the shutdown of your computer.
If, like me, you spend all your time coding and/or watching series, you'll find this tool to be very handy!


### 📝 Rename It
Rename It is a tool consisting of adding the current date as a prefix of file's name.
After asking you the extension of the files to be renamed, it will search those matching the extension in the current folder and update them.


### 🔑 Pass Generator
Tool allowing you to choose the length of your password plus decide whether or not you want to use special characters.
Regarding the previous setup, the Pass Generator will generate a random password to secure your account without the inconvenient to spend more time than necessary to create it.
