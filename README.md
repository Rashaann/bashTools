### Timer
Timer allows you to program the shutdown of your computer.
If, like me, you spend all the time coding and/or watching series, you'll find this tool to be very handy!


### Rename It
Rename It is a tool consisting of adding the current date as a prefix of file's name.
After asking you the extension of the files to be renamed, it will search those matching the extension in the current folder and update them.
